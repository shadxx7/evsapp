      <h3>Infiltration</h3>
      <p>
        Infiltration is the process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil. Infiltration rate in soil science is a measure of the rate at which soil is able to absorb rainfall or irrigation. It is measured in inches per hour or millimeters per hour.
        The rate decreases as the soil becomes saturated. If the precipitation rate exceeds the infiltration rate, runoff will usually occur unless there is some physical barrier. It is related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the near-surface
        soil. The rate of infiltration can be measured using an infiltrometer.

      <h3>Sub-Surface Flow</h3>
      <p>
        In hydrological terms, subsurface flow is the flow of water beneath the Earth's surface as part of the water cycle. When precipitation falls on the earth's land, some of the water flows on the surface forming streams and rivers. The remaining water, through infiltration,
        penetrates the soil traveling underground, hydrating the soil, recharging aquifers, with the excess flowing in subsurface runoff.Water flows from areas where the water table is higher to areas where it is lower. The amount of runoff reaching surface
        and groundwater can vary significantly, depending on rainfall, soil moisture, permeability, groundwater storage, evaporation, upstream use, and whether or not the ground is frozen. The movement of subsurface water is determined largely by the
        water gradient, type of substrate, and any barriers to flow.

      <h3>Evaporation</h3>
      <p>
        Evaporation is a sort of vaporization, that happens on the surface of a fluid as it changes into the gaseous phase.The encompassing gas must not be saturated with the dissipating substance. At the point when the particles of the fluid collide, they exchange
        energy to each other in view of how they impact. At the point when a particle close to the surface ingests enough energy to defeat the vapor pressure, it will "escape" and enter the surrounding air as a gas. In an encased situation, the a fluid
        will vanish until the point when the encompassing air is immersed. Evaporation is a fundamental piece of the water cycle. The (sun powered energy) drives evaporation of water from seas, lakes, dampness in the dirt, and different wellsprings of
        water. Studies have demonstrated that the seas, oceans, lakes, and waterways give about 90 percent of the moisture in the air by means of evaporation, with the rest of the 10 percent being contributed by plant transpiration. Evaporation, similar
        to precipitation, is estimated in inches or milimeter every year. It depends on the following major factors -

      <h3>Transpiration</h3>
      <p>
        Transpiration is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere. Transpiration is essentially evaporation of water from plant leaves.
        Transpiration also includes a process called guttation, which is the loss of water in liquid form from the uninjured leaf or stem of the plant, principally through water stomata. Plants put down roots into the soil to draw water and nutrients
        up into the stems and leaves. Some of this water is returned to the air by transpiration (when combined with evaporation, the total process is known as evapotranspiration). Transpiration rates vary widely depending on weather conditions, such
        as temperature, humidity, sunlight availability and intensity, precipitation, soil type and saturation, wind, land slope, and water use and diversion by people. During dry periods, transpiration can contribute to the loss of moisture in the upper
        soil zone, which can have an effect on vegetation and food-crop fields

      <h3>Runoff</h3>
      <p>
        Surface runoff (also known as overland flow) is the flow of water that occurs when excess stormwater, meltwater, or other sources flows over the Earth's surface. This might occur because soil is saturated to full capacity, because rain arrives more quickly
        than soil can absorb it, or because impervious areas (roofs and pavement) send their runoff to surrounding soil that cannot absorb all of it. Surface runoff is a major component of the water cycle. It is the primary agent in soil erosion by water.
        In addition to causing water erosion and pollution, surface runoff in urban areas is a primary cause of urban flooding which can result in property damage, damp and mold in basements, and street flooding. Runoff that occurs on the ground surface
        before reaching a channel is also called a nonpoint source. If a nonpoint source contains man-made contaminants, or natural forms of pollution (such as rotting leaves) the runoff is called nonpoint source pollution. A land area which produces
        runoff that drains to a common point is called a drainage basin. When runoff flows along the ground, it can pick up soil contaminants including petroleum, pesticides, or fertilizers that become discharge or nonpoint source pollution

      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>
        The precipitated water that infiltrates from the land surface is stored in the ground. The water is not stagnant and is still a part of the water cycle. In the upper layer, the soil is not yet saturated and the amount of water keeps varying with time
        In the layer below this, all the spaces between rock particles are filled with water and this saturated layer is called groundwater. If these water bearing zones are capable of yielding enough water to supply people's houses, then they are called
        aquifers.

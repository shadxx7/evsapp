## Description

A simple application built on Electron that simulates particular instances of the Hydrological Cycle. The simulation works on the basis of the Hydrological Budget Equation, each parameter of which is given a range that is varied across a set timeframe. In this manner, the application renders a graph of expected precipitation in the localized region corresponding to the input values over the particular timeframe.
